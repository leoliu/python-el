 INTRODUCTION
==============

``python.el`` is a decent python mode for emacs developed by `Dave
Love`_ that had been part of GNU emacs for quite a few years. It
provides tight integration with standard elisp packages such as
``comint.el``, ``compile.el``, ``info-look.el`` and ``gud.el``. Many
people have been using it for authoring python. They provide feedback
and bug fixes to ensure it works reliably in all major platforms.

As of this writing (2012/08/01), upstream has replaced ``python.el``
with another implementation that provides more or less the same
feature set. Being a happy user of Dave's ``python.el``, I extracted
``python.el`` from `emacs trunk`_ keeping the revision history and
placed it here for the convenience of people so that they don't have
to fix something that ain't broken.
