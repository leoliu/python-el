;;; Commentary:

;; Major mode for editing Python, with support for inferior processes.

;; There is another Python mode, python-mode.el, used by XEmacs and
;; maintained with Python.  That isn't covered by an FSF copyright
;; assignment, unlike this code, and seems not to be well-maintained
;; for Emacs (though I've submitted fixes).  This mode is rather
;; simpler and is, perhaps, better in other ways.  In particular,
;; using the syntax functions with text properties maintained by
;; font-lock should make it more correct with arbitrary string and
;; comment contents.

;; This doesn't implement all the facilities of python-mode.el.  Some
;; just need doing, e.g. catching exceptions in the inferior Python
;; buffer (but see M-x pdb for debugging).  [Actually, the use of
;; `compilation-minor-mode' now is probably enough for that.]  Others
;; don't seem appropriate.  For instance, `forward-into-nomenclature'
;; should be done separately, since it's not specific to Python, and
;; I've installed a minor mode to do the job properly in Emacs 22.
;; Other things seem more natural or canonical here, e.g. the
;; {beginning,end}-of-defun implementation dealing with nested
;; definitions, and the inferior mode following `cmuscheme'.  (The
;; inferior mode should be able to find the source of errors from
;; `python-send-region' & al via `compilation-minor-mode', but I can't
;; make that work with the current (March '04) compile.el.)
;; Successive TABs cycle between possible indentations for the line.

;; Even where it has similar facilities, this is incompatible with
;; python-mode.el in various respects.  For instance, various key
;; bindings are changed to obey Emacs conventions, and things like
;; marking blocks and `beginning-of-defun' behave differently.

;; TODO: See various Fixmes below.  It should be possible to arrange
;; some sort of completion using the inferior interpreter.

;;; Code:

;; It's messy to autoload the relevant comint functions so that comint
;; is only required when inferior Python is used.

  "Major mode for editing Python files.
Turns on Font Lock mode unconditionally since it is required for correct
parsing of the source.
See also `jython-mode', which is actually invoked if the buffer appears to
contain Jython code.  See also `run-python' and associated Python mode
commands for running Python under Emacs.

The Emacs commands which work with `defun's, e.g. \\[beginning-of-defun], deal
with nested `def' and `class' blocks.  They take the innermost one as
current without distinguishing method and class definitions.  Used multiple
times, they move over others at the same indentation level until they reach
the end of definitions at that level, when they move up a level.
\\<python-mode-map>
Colon is electric: it outdents the line if appropriate, e.g. for
an else statement.  \\[python-backspace] at the beginning of an indented statement
deletes a level of indentation to close the current block; otherwise it
deletes a charcter backward.  TAB indents the current line relative to
the preceding code.  Successive TABs, with no intervening command, cycle
through the possibilities for indentation on the basis of enclosing blocks.

\\[fill-paragraph] fills comments and multiline strings appropriately, but has no
effect outside them.

Supports Eldoc mode (only for functions, using a Python process),
Info-Look and Imenu.  In Outline minor mode, `class' and `def'
lines count as headers.
